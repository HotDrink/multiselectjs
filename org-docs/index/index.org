#+TITLE: {{{msjs}}}

{{{msjs}}} is a library for implementing selection of multiple elements from visual collections with a mouse and keyboard.

The library's multiselection abstraction is not bound to a widget or
control; it can be applied to any context.  To implement
multiselection, the application programmers main tasks are to:

  - implement a /selection geometry/ object that determines how mouse
    points indicate a set of elements (and a few other things);
  - implement functions to visualize selected and not-selected
    elements and cursors used in selecting elements; and
  - bind mouse and keyboard events to {{{msjs}}}'s functions.

The library provides a rich multiselection feature, including mouse
and keyboard selection so that they are compatible with each other,
undoing and redoing selections, selecting based on a predicate, and
changing selection geometries on the fly.  The different aspecs of
multiselection are showcased in [[file:examples/demo/multiselect-demo.html][a demo application]].

Our [[file:docs/tutorial/tutorial.html][tutorial]] describes the basic concepts of multiselection and shows
step-by-step how to apply the library in a few example situations.

The manuscript /One Way to Select Many/, by Jaakko JÃ¤rvi and Sean
Parent, is a full account of the motivations behind {{{msjs}}} and the
theory of of multi-selection that its design is based on. As the
manuscript is currently under review, it is not publicly available at
the moment. Please [[mailto:jarvij@gmail.com][request a copy by email]].
